**CMSIS DSD for PULPino**

This is a port of ARM CMSIS DSP [library](http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/DSP/html/index.html) to [PULPino](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpino) microcontroller(RISC-V  RV32IMFD ISA with custom extensions).

This [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5599084384616448) is part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2017.

Check the project at [Github](https://github.com/misaleh/CMSIS-DSP-PULPino).
