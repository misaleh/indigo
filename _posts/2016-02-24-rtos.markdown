I have made a free online RTOS course in Arabic,  Check it on [VLSI academy](http://www.vlsiacademy.org/rtos1.html) and also on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVxBVAdu4pn7UTHjmslHicZiYtyRbxs6z)

## Course Info.

    This is a Real time operating system (RTOS) course, the course focuses on RTOS concepts, features, and APIs.
    It does not focus much on real time systems design.
    The first part of the course focuses on RTOS generally, and explains its basic concepts, it consists of 10 sessions.
    The second part focuses on a certain RTOS which is FreeRTOS, it consists of 12 sessions and 9 labs using TIVA C within them.
