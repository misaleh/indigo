## Research Experience
 * During My bachelor studies at Alexandria University, I was a Research Assistant in a research group, where we Studied the implementation of [SHA-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) algorithm on the 32-bit MIPS processor, Then we improved the performance with two approaches, using Instruction-Set Extension (ISE) and a Co-processor approach where both improved the throughput significantly with minor resources overhead.
This Research was performed using Codasip Studio provided by [Codasip](https://www.codasip.com/).


* I was a member of CAN-SAT project held by Bibliotheca Alexandria.
Where we developed a CAN-SAT used for environmental purposes, it performed tasks as measuring, collecting and sending surrounding environment data to the ground station, also there was two camera which was used to estimate the depth of the ground from the satellite and for streaming video to a VR in the ground station. The CAN-SAT was launched in NARSS(National Authority for Remote Sensing & Space Sciences) successfully.
